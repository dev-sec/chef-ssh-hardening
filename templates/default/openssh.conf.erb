# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file. 
# See ssh_config(5) for more information on any settings used. Comments will be added only to clarify why a configuration was chosen.
# 
# Created for OpenSSH v5.9

# Basic configuration
# ===================

# Address family should always be limited to the active network configuration.
AddressFamily <%= ((@node['network']['ipv6']['enable']) ? "any" : "inet" ) %>

<% Array(@node['ssh']['remote_hosts']).each do |host| %>
# Restrict the following configuration to be limited to this Host.
Host <%= host %>
<% end %>

<% Array(@node['ssh']['ports']).each do |ssh_port| %>
# The port at the destination should be defined
Port <%= ssh_port %>
<% end %>

# Identity file configuration. You may restrict available identity files. Otherwise ssh will search for a pattern and use any that matches.
#IdentityFile ~/.ssh/identity
#IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa


# Security configuration
# ======================

# Set the protocol version to 2 for security reasons. Disables legacy support.
Protocol 2

# Make sure passphrase querying is enabled
BatchMode no

# Prevent IP spoofing by checking to host IP against the `known_hosts` file.
CheckHostIP yes

# Always ask before adding keys to the `known_hosts` file. Do not set to `yes`.
StrictHostKeyChecking ask

# **Ciphers** -- If your clients don't support CTR (eg older versions), cbc will be added
# CBC: is true if you want to connect with OpenSSL-base libraries
# eg ruby Net::SSH::Transport::CipherFactory requires cbc-versions of the given openssh ciphers to work
# -- see: (http://net-ssh.github.com/net-ssh/classes/Net/SSH/Transport/CipherFactory.html)
# 
<% if @cipher %>
Ciphers <%= @cipher %>
<% end %>

# **Hash algorithms** -- Make sure not to use SHA1 for hashing, unless it is really necessary.
# Weak HMAC is sometimes required if older package versions are used 
# eg Ruby's Net::SSH at around 2.2.* doesn't support sha2 for hmac, so this will have to be set true in this case.
# 
<% if @mac %>
MACs <%= @mac %>
<% end %>

# Alternative setting, if OpenSSH version is below v5.9
#MACs hmac-ripemd160

# **Key Exchange Algorithms** -- Make sure not to use SHA1 for kex, unless it is really necessary
# Weak kex is sometimes required if older package versions are used
# eg ruby's Net::SSH at around 2.2.* doesn't support sha2 for kex, so this will have to be set true in this case.
# 
<% if @kex %>
KexAlgorithms <%= @kex %>
<% end %>


# Disable agent formwarding, since local agent could be accessed through forwarded connection.
ForwardAgent no

# Disable X11 forwarding, since local X11 display could be accessed through forwarded connection.
ForwardX11 no

# Never use host-based authentication. It can be exploited.
HostbasedAuthentication no
RhostsRSAAuthentication no

# Enable RSA authentication via identity files.
RSAAuthentication yes

# Disable password-based authentication, it can allow for potentially easier brute-force attacks.
PasswordAuthentication no

# Only use GSSAPIAuthentication if implemented on the network.
GSSAPIAuthentication no
GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no

# Disable tunneling
Tunnel no

# Disable local command execution.
PermitLocalCommand no


# Misc. configuration
# ===================

# Enable compression. More pressure on the CPU, less on the network.
Compression yes

#EscapeChar ~
#VisualHostKey yes
